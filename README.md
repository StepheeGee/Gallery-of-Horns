#### Comments:
If we can't change the html file, then how do we change the main part of our page. I want to increase the margin (left and right) on the main section but not on the body - which includes the header and footer. But there isn't a main element in the index.html file.

I finally got my relative file paths correct. So my files are importing correctly. I was too afraid to try modules.css, because I didn't want to completely break my app again. So I updated the css in index which is global. I would've preferred to add css to the components. For instance, since all my cards are styled the same, that could've been a hornedbeast module.css. 

I also have an error in one of my functions that I can't figure out. In my hornedbeast.jsx file, I have a hornedbeast function. The parameters of the function have squiggly lines and the error states that those parameters are missing in prop validation. But I don't know how to do that. I know that I need those parameters in that function, but I don't know how to make the error message go away.
